Introduction

Messaging Limits

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.

[​](#all-plans)

All Plans
----------------------------

*   **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable’s features at no cost.

[​](#free-plan)

Free Plan
----------------------------

*   5 free messages per day (chat or edit mode)
    
*   Maximum of 30 messages per month
    

[​](#available-paid-plans)

Available Paid Plans
--------------------------------------------------

Each paid plan includes a set number of allocated messages, plus 5 free daily messages available to all users.

| Plan | Daily Messages | Monthly Messages | Paid Limit Multiplier | Total Messages Per Month |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starter** | 5   | 100 | \-  | **250** |
| **Launch** | 5   | 250 | 2.5x | **400** |

.

[​](#upgrading-and-downgrading-plans)

Upgrading and Downgrading Plans
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading

When upgrading your plan, the cost is adjusted based on the time left in your current billing cycle. You’ll only pay the difference between what you’ve already paid and the cost of the new plan for the remaining days in the billing period. This amount will be charged immediately.

Downgrading

**When downgrading your plan:**

*   **No immediate changes** occur to your subscription.
*   The downgrade will take effect at the **start of the next billing period**, at which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.

Legacy Plans

Some early access users are “grandfathered” on their existing plans, but can choose to move to the new plans before the old (“pro”) plan is officially deprecated.

[​](#common-issues-and-troubleshooting)

Common Issues and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pricing Changes or Charges

Lovable sends community and email notifications about any upcoming pricing changes. Please ensure your email is up-to-date in your account settings.

Errors During Payment Setup

Occasionally, payment setups may fail due to issues with Stripe. If this occurs, double-check your payment details and retry. If problems persist, contact our support team for assistance.

Change payment cards

You can update your payment method anytime by navigating to **Account Settings > Plans & Billing** and managing your details through Stripe.

Paid Users Losing Access

This typically happens due to billing issues (e.g., expired cards). Ensure your payment method is valid to avoid interruptions.

Resolving Overages or Refunds

If you experience message overages or require a refund, reach out to our support team. We handle these on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair resolution.

'Chat Mode' credits consumption

A few weeks ago, we introduced **Chat Mode** as a [**Labs feature**](/features/labs)
 (accessible: **Account > Settings > Labs**), and the feedback from early testers has been overwhelmingly positive. We’ve since expanded its capabilities, making it feel like you’re chatting with a seasoned CTO who understands your projects and goals inside and out.

However, these advanced features come with additional costs, so **messages sent in Chat Mode will now count towards your message limit**:

*   1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
    
*   All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
    
*   There will be no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode
    
*   Workaround: If you use Edit Mode without asking the AI to write code, it won’t count towards your message limit—**but Chat Mode functionalities won’t be available in that case.**
    

We’re excited to keep improving Chat Mode and appreciate your continued feedback!

'Try to Fix' button counting as messages

Messages triggered by “Ask the AI to fix” don’t count toward your usage limits only if pressed on the button. If you are trying to [fix errors](/tips-tricks/troubleshooting)
 with an additional prompt, that counts as message credit.

All other messages count regardless of their outcome.

Overview

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to create a full-stack application using Lovable. Each section is accompanied by a video to make things more visual.

Create your first project

To get started, head over to [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)
 and create an account.

Once registered, you’ll be able to create your first project. Simply enter an initial prompt to kick things off, and Lovable will do the rest!

Getting Started

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

1.  **Prompting** Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple. Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific you are, the better the results. Start with clear and detailed prompts. You can refine and adjust your project as you go. Example: _“Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart.”_
    
2.  **Templates** Lovable offers [templates](https://lovable.dev/templates)
     to help you get started quickly on popular project types, such as dashboards, e-commerce sites, or social apps, for a quick setup. Once the template loads, use prompts to adjust features, add new elements, or fine-tune the design to match your vision.
    
3.  **Remix** You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version. Note that it is not possible to remix projects when Supabase is connected.
    
4.  **Using Figma** If you have a design in Figma, take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.
    
5.  **Sketching with [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/)
    ** Use Excalidraw or any similar tool to sketch your UI. Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable. The platform will transform your sketch into working code.
    
6.  **Cloning a Website or Application** If you want to replicate an existing webpage, take a screenshot using shortcuts like _Cmd+Shift+4_ on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl)
    . Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable, and it will recreate the structure of the webpage in your project.
    

Each of these methods helps you kickstart your project with ease and flexibility.

Add a custom knowledge to your project

The [Knowledge Base](https://lovable.dev/blog/project-knowledge-files)
 in Lovable acts as your project’s blueprint, where you define details like functionality, design elements, and goals. To set it up, create new entries in the **Knowledge Base** section of your dashboard, organizing them into categories such as Project Overview, Key Features, or Design Guidelines.

You can link these entries directly to your prompts, ensuring clarity, consistency, and alignment with your project requirements. The Knowledge Base also serves as a collaborative tool for teams, streamlining communication and keeping everyone aligned.

Regularly update your entries as your project evolves to maintain relevance and ensure your app development stays on track.

Select & make edit

Revert a change

Lovable offers intuitive editing tools and undo functionality, giving you the freedom to experiment without worry. You can make direct edits, use prompts for adjustments, or leverage the Select tool for precise changes. If a change doesn’t work out, use the **Undo** button to reverse your actions, or explore the **Version History** to restore earlier versions of your project.

To test edits, use the **Preview** mode to see real-time changes and easily revert them if needed. For effective editing, make incremental changes, save major updates using versioning, and document key changes for team alignment. Lovable ensures a seamless editing experience, empowering you to refine your projects with confidence.

Add custom components with 21st dev

Add animation component

Add images to my prompt

Visuals often speak louder than words. You can attach images directly to the chat to provide additional context for your prompts. This is particularly useful for illustrating ideas or concepts that are easier to show than describe.

Add a new page

Refactor code

Add images to your application

Want to add images directly to your application? Simply upload them in the chat and explain to Lovable’s AI where and how you’d like them to appear in your project.

Connect to GitHub

Integrate your project with GitHub to iterate on your application seamlessly. You can make code changes in GitHub or your preferred IDE while keeping everything in sync with Lovable.

Connect a backend to your application

Supabase is a backend-as-a-service platform that integrates smoothly with Lovable to add powerful backend capabilities to your application.

In this video, you’ll get familiar with the Supabase dashboard and learn how to create your first project:

*   **Set Up Supabase** Create an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
     and create a new project.
    
*   **Link to Lovable** In Lovable, go to **Settings -> Connect Supabase** and follow the steps.
    
*   **Manage Data** Set up tables, manage user data, and configure email notifications.
    

Getting started with Supabase

After setting up your Supabase project, you’ll need to connect it to your Lovable project. This connection enables Lovable to leverage Supabase’s backend services seamlessly.

Add authentication with Supabase

Supabase makes implementing user authentication simple and efficient. With just a few steps, you can add secure login and signup functionalities to your application.

Getting authentication right is a critical part of any developer’s workflow. When you’re juggling landing pages, database connections, and user login flows, the process can quickly become overwhelming. Luckily, Supabase provides a powerful yet simple approach to handle authentication—especially when paired with Lovable.

[In this guide](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/lovable-f9060f1e/lovable-f9060f1e/editor/main#how-can-i-design-an-authentification)
, we’ll walk you through building a landing page, connecting to Supabase, configuring authentication, and avoiding common pitfalls along the way.

To add Google authentication:

Store data with Supabase

If your application requires data storage, Lovable can integrate with Supabase to store and manage your data effortlessly. Just define your requirements, and Lovable handles the rest.

Use an API with Lovable

Supabase Edge Functions allow you to add advanced capabilities to your application. Whether you need AI features, payment processing, or email integration, Edge Functions provide the flexibility to power up your app.

Get started with your first full-stack app on Lovable using this guide. For additional resources and inspiration, visit the [Lovable YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lovable-labs/videos)
, which features regular office hours recordings and other helpful content.

Add payment capabilities to your application

There are many ways to connect Stripe to Lovable, but the most straight-forward way is to utilize Stripe’s built in payment links. [Use this resource to make sure you get this right!](https://lovable.dev/blog/how-to-connect-stripe-lovable)

Add AI capabilities

You can add multiple different AI capabilities to your application like:

*   OpenAI

*   Gemini

Add email capabilities with Resend

Set up SEO

Publish my project

When your project is ready, publish it to generate a shareable URL. This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

Lovable with Cursor

Let’s get building!

Chat Mode

Lovable’s Chat Mode is an experimental feature designed to enhance your workflow by allowing you to interact with Lovable through chat without directly editing your project. It was launched a couple weeks ago and have gotten very good feedback from early testers. We have now started to extend its capabilities and its starting to feel like talking to a seasoned CTO who knows your projects and goals inside and out.

Because these capabilities come with additional costs, messages in Chat Mode will now start counting towards your message limit.

Precise Edits

[​](#visual-edits)

Visual Edits
----------------------------------

Lovable brings programming into the hands of non-technical people, but we knew from working closely with designers that having to chat with AI for every small edit wasn’t ideal. Visual Edits emerged from this collaboration, combining AI-powered development with precise Tailwind-native visual control. It’s about giving everyone the power to build and refine their vision, whether through natural language or direct manipulation.

The **Visual Edit** tool in Lovable enables precise edits to specific UI components, offering flexibility and control in your design process.

Activate the tool from the editor toolbar, hover over the desired element (e.g., button, text, image), and click to bring up editing options. You can:

*   Update attributes like text, colors, layout, or functionality directly.
    
*   Edit font weights, alignments, image resizing.
    
*   Select parent elements.
    

For more complex adjustments, use AI-powered prompts to fine-tune your edits. Preview your changes in real-time and save them when satisfied. This feature streamlines targeted edits, helping you refine your designs effortlessly.

**Keyboard shortcut**

*   Option + s on Mac
    
*   Alt + s on PC
    

[​](#using-the-figma-integration)

Using the Figma Integration
----------------------------------------------------------------

Designers can now export their Figma designs directly into Lovable to build full-stack apps without needing developers.

This [Figma-to-code guide](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration)
 walks you through every step, from structuring Figma designs to using Builder.io’s plugin and leveraging Lovable for seamless app creation.

[​](#knowledge-files)

Knowledge Files
----------------------------------------

Every project has its own unique context, goals, and challenges. A knowledge file captures this _custom context_ and serves as a living document that evolves with your project.

1.  **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project, its goals, and objectives.
    
2.  **User Personas:** Detailed descriptions of your target users and their needs.
    
3.  **Feature Specifications:** Include user stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed descriptions of each feature.

[​](#code-and-development)

Code and Development
--------------------------------------------------

Can I download the code Lovable generates?

Yes, you can easily get access to the code generated by Lovable via our [GitHub integration](/integrations/git-integration)
.

Can I use Lovable with my own backend?

Absolutely! Lovable can generate code that connects to any backend. While connecting to most backends may require some technical knowledge, we’ve made it easy to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
 and its [native integration with Lovable](integrations/supabase)
.

Can Lovable write React Native/NextJS code?

No, Lovable can only generate applications based on Vite and React at the moment.

How does Lovable handles duplicated code?

Previously, when adding functionality, the AI sometimes created duplicate files, causing confusion and errors where changes were applied to a hidden duplicate instead of the visible file.

This update ensures the system now detects and excludes duplicate files, significantly reducing “could not be applied” errors.

As a result, users—especially those building larger applications—will experience more reliable AI behavior, with changes correctly applied and fewer inconsistencies. This fix is automatically applied to all projects, requiring no action from users, and is part of our ongoing effort to enhance AI accuracy and scalability.

What is a webhook, and how does it work?

A **webhook** is a way for two applications to communicate automatically. It acts as a “listener” that waits for specific events and triggers an action in response.

For example, in Lovable:

1.  A user submits a form.
    
2.  The form data is sent to a webhook URL (like an API endpoint).
    
3.  The webhook processes the data and triggers another action, such as storing the information in a database or sending an email notification.
    

**Key uses of webhooks:**

*   **Real-time automation** – instantly process incoming data.
    
*   **Integrations with external tools** – connect Lovable with services like Slack, Stripe, or Supabase.
    
*   **Handling API responses** – send data between systems without manual intervention.
    

When using webhooks, always:

*   **Ensure the webhook URL is correct and secure** to prevent data leaks.
    
*   **Handle responses properly** – Lovable should expect a return confirmation to ensure successful execution.
    

What is refactoring, and why is it important?

**Refactoring** is the process of improving the structure, readability, and efficiency of existing code without changing its functionality. It’s like editing a long essay to make it more concise while keeping the same message.

In AI-generated development, refactoring can help:

*   **Optimize performance** by reducing redundant code.
    
*   **Improve maintainability** for easier debugging and future updates.
    
*   **Prevent conflicts** by organizing logic more clearly.
    

However, unnecessary refactoring can introduce bugs. Before refactoring, always:

*   **Ask AI what it plans to change** (e.g., in Lovable’s Chat Mode).
    
*   **Ensure all dependencies remain functional** to avoid breaking other parts of your application.
    

Can I use Lovable for frontend development?

Yes! You can absolutely use **Lovable** for frontend development.

Lovable provides an intuitive, AI-powered environment that simplifies frontend workflows, making it easier to build, style, and optimize web applications. Whether you’re working with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**, or customizing UI components through **visual editing**, Lovable offers tools to streamline the development process.

Prompt Engineering

To help you make the most out of Lovable, we compiled a list of prompting strategies and approaches. Some of these were collected from our team’s experience, and others were shared with us by our community members.

**What is prompting?** Prompting is the term for textual, natural language inputs used to interact with Lovable. You can think of it as messages containing instructions you give to Lovable.

Since Lovable relies on large language models (LLMs), effective prompting strategies can significantly improve its efficiency and accuracy.

[​](#basics)

Basics
----------------------

Prompts are the primary way to interact with Lovable app:

1.  **Welcome Screen**: Start with prebuilt prompts or create your own.
    
2.  **Builder UI**: Use the chat-based interface to iterate quickly.
    

Prompts serve as the backbone of all interactions.

* * *

[​](#prompting-strategies)

Prompting strategies
--------------------------------------------------

These strategies will often work combined, depending on your specific use cases. Feel free to experiment with them and see which ones give the best results. While Lovable on its own can do a lot even from a very basic and generic prompt, using some of these strategies can help you achieve even better results.

### 

[​](#contextual-prompting)

Contextual prompting

Providing context can help Lovable understand the broader scope of your requirements. Before asking for specific tasks, you can set the stage with background information.

**Setting the context**

    We are building a project management tool that helps teams track their tasks.
    This tool should have features like:
     - user authentication
     - project creation
     - task assignments
     - reporting
    
    Now, for the first task, create the UI for project creation.
    

**Another example:**

    I need a CRM app with Supabase integration and a secure auth flow. Start by setting up the backend.
    

**Another example:**

    We are developing an e-commerce platform focusing on eco-friendly products. Generate a product listing page with filters for category and price.
    

### 

[​](#incremental-prompting)

Incremental prompting

Our experience has shown that making incremental, smaller changes will yield better results than dumping a huge prompt and expecting AI to handle it well.

**DON’T**:

    Build a CRM app with Supabase, auth, Google Sheets export, and data enrichment.
    

**DO**:

    Set up a Supabase-connected CRM backend.
    

    Great! Could you please add a secure authentication flow with user roles?
    

    Thank you! The next step is to integrate Google Sheets to export records.
    

**Another example:**

    Set up a database schema for user information.
    

    Develop an API endpoint to retrieve user data please
    

### 

[​](#using-image-prompts)

Using image prompts

You as a user can upload images with your prompt and ask Lovable to build a solution based on it.

There are two main approaches here. The first one is a simple prompting approach.

**Simple image upload prompting**

You can upload an image and then add an example prompt like this:

    Create and implement a UI that looks as similar as possible to the image attached.
    

    This screenshot shows a layout issue on mobile. Adjust margins and padding to make it responsive while keeping the same design structure.
    

Or, you can help AI better understand the content of the image and some additional specifics about it. Excellent results can be achieved by adding specific instructions to the image uploaded. While the image is worth a thousand words, adding a couple of your own to describe desired functionality can go a long way - especially since interactions cannot always be obvious from a static image.

**Image prompting with detailed instructions**

    I want you to create the app as similar as possible to the one shown in this screenshot.
    It's essentially a kanban clone.
    It should have the ability to add new cards (tickets) in each column, have the ability to change the order of those tickets within a single column, and even move those cards between columns.
    Feel free to use the Pangea home dnd npm package for drag-and-drop functionality.
    

### 

[​](#feedback-integration)

Feedback integration

Review the AI’s output and provide specific feedback for refinements.

    The login form looks good, but please add validation for the email field to ensure it contains a valid email address.
    

### 

[​](#avoid-ambiguity)

Avoid ambiguity

Ensure your prompts are clear and unambiguous. Avoid vague terms and be as specific as possible about what you need.

**DON’T**:

    Make this app better.
    

**Another example:**

    Create a form for user input
    

**DO**:

    Refactor the app to clean up unused components and improve performance, without changing UI or functionality.
    

**Another example:**

    Create a user registration form with fields for username, email, and password and include a submit button.
    

### 

[​](#add-constraints)

Add constraints

Sometimes, adding constraints can help focus the AI on what’s important and avoid unnecessary complexity.

**Adding constraints**

    Create a simple to-do app with a maximum of 3 tasks visible at a time.
    Include the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.
    

    Optimize this code, but ensure the UI and core functionality remain unchanged. Document each change you make.
    

### 

[​](#be-nice)

Be nice!

Even though it may sound surprising, recent studies have shown that polite prompts with basic professional courtesy yield better results. This is because respectful prompts often include a few extra words, which provide more context for the AI. Please keep this in mind for your next prompt.

[​](#advanced-prompting-strategies)

Advanced Prompting Strategies
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[​](#emphasizing-accessibility)

Emphasizing Accessibility

Encourage the generation of code that adheres to accessibility standards and modern best practices. This ensures that the output is not only functional but also user-friendly and compliant with accessibility guidelines.

    Generate a React component for a login form that follows accessibility best practices, including appropriate ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
    

### 

[​](#predefined-components-and-libraries)

Predefined Components and Libraries

Specify the use of certain UI libraries or components to maintain consistency and efficiency in your project. This directs the AI to utilize specific tools, ensuring compatibility and a uniform design language across your application.

    Create a responsive navigation bar using the shadcn/ui library with Tailwind CSS for styling.
    

### 

[​](#implementing-chain-of-thought-cot-prompts)

Implementing Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompts

For complex tasks, encourage the AI to process the problem step by step before providing a solution. This methodical approach helps in breaking down intricate tasks, leading to more accurate and comprehensive solutions.

    Let's think through the process of setting up a secure authentication system:
    1. What are the necessary components?
    2. How should they interact?
    3. Provide the implementation code.
    

### 

[​](#multilingual-prompting)

Multilingual Prompting

When working in a multilingual environment, specify the desired language for both code comments and documentation. This ensures that the generated content is accessible to team members who speak different languages, enhancing collaboration.

    Generate a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence. Provide comments and documentation in French.
    

### 

[​](#defining-project-structure-and-file-management)

Defining Project Structure and File Management

Clearly outline the project structure, including file names and paths, to ensure organized and maintainable code generation. This provides clarity on where new components should reside within the project, maintaining a coherent file organization.

    Create a new React component named 'UserProfile' and save it as 'components/user-profile.tsx'. Ensure it includes a profile picture, username, and bio section.
    

[​](#debugging-and-issue-reporting)

Debugging and Issue Reporting
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[​](#debugging-instructions)

Debugging Instructions

Follow these steps for systematic debugging:

*   **Task Identification**: List and prioritize all tasks.
    
*   **Internal Review**: Verify your solution internally before submission.
    
*   **Reporting**: Confirm each completed task with clear, verifiable results.
    
*   **DOM Validation**: Ensure changes render in the DOM. Provide DOM tags or feedback for verification.
    
*   **Qualifying Questions**: Clarify any uncertainties before proceeding.
    
*   **Error Handling and Logging**: Use robust error handling and verbose `console.log`. Never remove logs until production.
    
*   **Debug Tools Management**: Implement a global switch to disable tools in production.
    
*   **Breakpoint Implementation**: Add breakpoints for isolating GPT-related bugs.
    
*   **Third-Party Packages**: Check for reusable libraries before writing new code.
    
*   **Leveraging Existing Systems**: Build on pre-existing features to ensure consistency.
    
*   **Code Audit**: Perform a detailed analysis, document issues, and plan a solution before making changes.
    

### 

[​](#debugging-flow)

Debugging Flow

To debug systematically:

1.  Add failing test cases.
    
2.  Isolate the problem and analyze dependencies.
    
3.  Document findings before applying fixes.
    

    Here's the failing console log. Analyze the test case, investigate the error in auth flow, and suggest a solution after understanding the dependencies.
    

### 

[​](#systematic-feedback)

**Systematic Feedback**

When reporting bugs or requesting changes:

1.  Describe the **current behavior** and issue.
    
2.  Outline the **expected behavior**.
    
3.  Add specific constraints.
    

    The webhook integration fails intermittently. Investigate why JWT verification toggles cause this and propose a fix.
    

### 

[​](#be-specific-when-correcting-issues)

Be specific when correcting issues

Issues will happen, sometimes builds will fail and the app that was generated will not look exactly as you wanted it. Effective prompting can help you get back on track. Again, it’s important to be specific.

Avoid generic and broad prompts

    Nothing works, fix it!
    

Instead, be more specific.

Make your prompts more detailed and specific

    Now the screen has gone blank and I am no longer able to make edits.
    Can you check what happened?
    

### 

[​](#using-dev-console-for-reporting-bugs)

Using Dev console for reporting bugs

If you are more technical and an issue has happened, then pasting an error logged in the browser’s Console can be very helpful.

Typically, you’ll open the [Dev tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
 and navigate to Console. If there are any errors or notifications visible, you can copy and paste them as a prompt.

Using Dev tools and console logs

    My app is not working anymore and the screen is blank.
    Here's the copy/paste from Dev tools console, can you fix the issue?
    
    Error occurred:
    TypeError: Q9() is undefined  at https://example.lovable.app/assets/index-DWQbrtrQQj.js
    : 435 : 39117 index-DWQbrtrQQj.js:435:35112
    onerror https://example.lovable.app/assets/index-DWQbrtrQQj.js:435
    

### 

[​](#practical-debugging-example)

**Practical Debugging Example**

A real-world step-by-step debugging flow in Lovable might look like this:

**Step 1**:

    Review this error log from the console. Identify the root cause in the auth flow.
    

**Step 2**:

    Now isolate the failing test and analyze what dependencies are breaking.
    

**Step 3**:

    Suggest a permanent solution after testing the auth fix in isolation.
    

[​](#lovable-prompts)

Lovable Prompts
----------------------------------------

To enhance your productivity, we’ve added specific Lovable Prompts for common scenarios:

### 

[​](#collaboration-and-process-prompts)

**Collaboration and Process Prompts**

For working collaboratively or debugging with a team:

    Review this GitHub project structure. Evaluate the flow, dependencies, and suggest improvements for scalability.
    

### 

[​](#error-debugging)

**Error Debugging**

Minor Errors:

    The same error persists. Do not make any code changes yet—investigate thoroughly to find the exact root cause. Analyze logs, flow, and dependencies deeply, and propose solutions only once you fully understand the issue.
    

Persistent Errors:

    The error is still unresolved. Stop and identify the exact root cause with 100% certainty—no guesses or assumptions. Analyze every aspect of the flow and dependencies in detail, and ensure full understanding before making any changes.
    

Major Errors:

    This is the final attempt to fix this issue. Stop all changes and methodically re-examine the entire flow—auth, Supabase, Stripe, state management, and redirects—from the ground up. Map out what’s breaking and why, test everything in isolation, and do not proceed without absolute certainty.
    

Clean up Console Logs:

    Carefully remove unnecessary console.log statements without affecting functionality or design. Review each log to ensure it’s non-critical, and document any that need alternative handling. Proceed methodically, testing thoroughly to confirm the app remains intact.
    

### 

[​](#refactoring)

**Refactoring**

Refactoring After Request Made by Lovable:

    Refactor this file without changing the UI or functionality—everything must behave and look exactly the same. Focus on improving code structure and maintainability only. Document the current functionality, ensure testing is in place, and proceed incrementally with no risks or regressions.
    

### 

[​](#design)

**Design**

UI Changes:

    Make only visual updates—do not impact functionality or logic in any way. Fully understand how the current UI integrates with the app, ensuring logic, state management, and APIs remain untouched. Test thoroughly to confirm the app behaves exactly as before.
    

Optimize for Mobile:

    Optimize the app for mobile without changing its design or functionality. Analyze the layout and responsiveness to identify necessary adjustments for smaller screens and touch interactions. Outline a detailed plan before editing any code, and test thoroughly across devices to ensure the app behaves exactly as it does now.
    

Modifying an Existing Feature:

    Make changes to the feature without impacting core functionality, other features, or flows. Analyze its behavior and dependencies to understand risks, and communicate any concerns before proceeding. Test thoroughly to confirm no regressions or unintended effects.
    

Fragile Update:

    This update is highly sensitive and demands extreme precision. Thoroughly analyze all dependencies and impacts before making changes, and test methodically to ensure nothing breaks. Avoid shortcuts or assumptions—pause and seek clarification if uncertain.
    

### 

[​](#pre-implementation-prompts)

**Pre-Implementation Prompts**

Before implementing significant changes:

    Plan out the API flow for this feature. Include endpoints, parameters, and how it connects with the database.
    

### 

[​](#experiment-with-chat-modes)

Experiment with chat modes

Chat modes are an experimental feature which allow you to switch how you interact with Lovable. We shipped Chat modes with:

1.  Default: Chat and make edits to your project.
    
2.  Chat only: Chat without making edits to your project.
    

We may ship extra chat modes in the future, or remove them altogether as we experiment with different ways of interacting with Lovable.

[​](#conclusion)

Conclusion
------------------------------

Prompting in Lovable becomes more powerful when you combine strategies like incremental prompting, contextual instructions, and the newly introduced **Lovable Prompts**. Experiment, iterate, and leverage these practices to streamline your workflows, debug effectively, and build robust applications.

Troubleshooting

[​](#try-to-fix-error-loops)

“Try to Fix” error loops
--------------------------------------------------------

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive, but even the best AI-powered development tools can run into issues. Sometimes, your code won’t execute as expected, or you might experience “unexpected behavior” where the AI doesn’t implement what you had in mind. 

[Here is a guide](https://lovable.dev/blog/never-get-stuck)
 to guide you through the _stuck_ experience:

*   **Use the ‘Try to Fix’ button first** – it automatically detects and resolves errors.
    
*   **Plan ahead with a structured prompt** – describe your project in detail, step by step.
    
*   **Leverage images** – visuals help Lovable understand UI-based errors.
    
*   **Use the ‘Revert’ button if needed** – go back to a stable version and rebuild logically.
    
*   **Ask Lovable for debugging help** – request an analysis of what went wrong and alternative solutions.
    

[​](#general-troubleshooting)

General Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------

When using Lovable, you may occasionally encounter technical issues. Below are common problems and recommended actions to troubleshoot and resolve them.

Persistent 'Fix Error' Loops

**Problem:** Repeated failures where errors persist despite multiple attempts to fix them.

**Solution:**

*   Approach with creativity: Adjust your input and prompts to help the AI understand the changes you’re trying to make.
    
*   Use Chat Mode: Engage the AI in chat mode for step-by-step guidance and tailored suggestions to break the loop.
    

Setting Environment Variables

**Problem:** Issues may arise when configuring environment variables, particularly with Supabase Edge Functions and Secrets.

**Solution:**

*   Double-check the environment variable syntax and names.
    
*   Refer to the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs)
     for guidance.
    

HTTP Fetch Failures

**Problem:** Errors during HTTP fetch requests can disrupt authentication or degrade app performance.

**Solution:** If you’re encountering an **HTTP server error** when working with APIs, it typically means the server you’re trying to communicate with is not responding as expected. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

*   **Check the API Status:** The issue might be on the server side. Verify if the API provider has reported downtime or maintenance.
    
*   **Review Your API Request:** Ensure your request is correctly formatted, including headers, authentication tokens, and payload structure.
    
*   **Test with a Different Tool:** Use tools like Postman or cURL to see if the issue persists outside of Lovable AI.
    
*   **Inspect Error Codes:** HTTP errors like `500` (internal server error) indicate server-side issues, while `400` series errors often mean there’s something wrong with the request.
    
*   **Retry After Some Time:** Temporary issues can be resolved by waiting and trying again later.
    
*   **Check Rate Limits:** Some APIs restrict the number of requests within a time frame—exceeding limits may result in errors.
    

If the issue persists and is related to Lovable AI’s platform, please reach out to our support team with error details for further assistance.

Can't use Mermaid AI

Lovable AI supports Mermaid.js for creating diagrams and flowcharts directly within your AI-generated content. To use Mermaid AI with Lovable AI, follow these steps:

*   **Embed Mermaid syntax** in your prompt or generated code blocks. Lovable AI recognizes standard Mermaid.js syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more.
    
*   **Use triple backticks (` ``` `) with “mermaid”** as the language identifier to ensure proper rendering. Example: graph TD; A\[Start\] —> B{Decision}; B —>|Yes| C\[Continue\]; B —>|No| D\[End\];
    
*   **Verify output** to ensure the diagram is correctly interpreted. If you encounter formatting issues, check for syntax errors in your Mermaid.js code.
    
*   **Optimize complexity** by keeping diagrams concise, as very large or intricate diagrams may require manual adjustments.
    

If Mermaid AI isn’t rendering as expected within Lovable AI, feel free to reach out to our support team for assistance.

Freezing or Loading Failures

**Problem:** Editor pages freeze, fail to load, or do not reflect the latest updates.

**Solution:** Report this as a bug via our [feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support)
.

Setup wizard-style flows

Lovable is designed to support various workflow structures, including setup wizards and assessment-style questionnaires. However, some users have encountered issues with looping errors in complex multi-step flows that generate reports at the end. If you’re experiencing this, we recommend:

1.  Breaking down the flow: Ensure that each step is clearly defined and that dependencies between steps are properly structured.
    
2.  Validating inputs at each stage: Sometimes, incorrect or unexpected inputs can cause loops—double-check validation rules.
    
3.  Using conditional logic carefully: If your flow depends on previous responses, review the conditions to prevent unintended loops.
    
4.  Testing with different user scenarios: Simulating various paths can help identify edge cases that may be causing issues.
    
5.  If the problem persists, please reach out to our support team with details of your setup, and we’ll be happy to assist in troubleshooting.
    

Avoiding AI mistakes in prompt engineering

*   Keep prompts **clear and structured**.
    
*   Use **reverse meta prompting** to refine results.
    
*   Test **in chat mode** before applying major changes.
    

Rollback Feature Fails

**Problem:** Unable to revert to a previous state of the project.

**Solution:** Submit a bug report via our [feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support)
.

Cloud Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Apps fail to redeploy or get stuck during deployment.

**Solution:** File a bug report via our [feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support)
.

AI-Related Errors

**Problem:** The AI is hallucinating or not resolving issues correctly.

**Solution:**

*   Revert to a stable version of your application.
    
*   Improve future prompts:
    
    *   Be specific and clear. Refer to our Prompting Handbook.
        
    *   Use the select tool for precise edits.
        
    *   Provide context by adding relevant documentation.
        

Refactor Broke Everything in My Code

**Problem:** Code refactor caused major issues.

**Solution:**

Challenges with Large Projects

**Problem:** Large projects encounter performance issues.

**Solution:** We’re optimizing AI performance for large projects. Stay tuned for updates.

*   **Session Memory Load:** Repeated edits accumulate processing history, which can slow down response time. Try refreshing your session or breaking large editing tasks into smaller segments.
    
*   **Complexity of Edits:** If your document or codebase is large and complex, each subsequent edit may require more computational resources. Consider refactoring your codebase by structuring edits more efficiently.
    
*   **Browser Performance:** Running Lovable AI for an extended period with intensive edits may strain browser memory. Restarting your browser or using a different one can help.
    

If performance degradation continues despite these optimizations, please reach out to our support team with details about your use case for further assistance.

If you encounter any other issues, reach out via our [feedback portal](https://lovable.dev/support)
 or explore our [prompting guide](/tips-tricks/prompting#debugging-and-issue-reporting)
.

[​](#github-troubleshooting)

GitHub Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------

Why are my recent commits not showing up in my Lovable project?

If you notice that your recent commits are missing from your Lovable project, it could be because the commits were made to a different branch on GitHub. Lovable currently only tracks commits made to the default branch (usually `main` or `master`). If you’ve been working on a new branch and haven’t merged it into the default branch, those commits won’t be picked up by Lovable.

**To ensure your commits are tracked:**

1.  Merge your changes into the default branch.
    
2.  If you’re working on a new branch, consider switching back to the default branch for commits you want to appear in Lovable.
    

[​](#api-troubleshooting)

API Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------

Connection and Authentication Issues

If you encounter difficulties connecting or authenticating with integrations, try the following:

1.  Double-check API credentials for accuracy.
2.  Ensure the required scopes or permissions are enabled.
3.  Verify network connectivity, as firewalls or proxies may block connections.

Refer to [GitHub Integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration)
 or [Supabase Integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)
 for detailed setup instructions.

API Credential Management

Lovable enables secure storage of API keys within your project settings (accessible from the **Settings** sidebar). To maintain security:

*   Store your keys in this designated secure location.
*   Avoid sharing them with others or using them in prompts unless absolutely necessary.

This ensures your credentials are protected and reduces the risk of misuse.

Challenges for Non-Developers

If you’re not a developer, integrating APIs might feel overwhelming. Lovable simplifies this with its in-chat configuration. For unsupported APIs, join the [Lovable community on Discord](https://discord.gg/jstGvUnFnm)
 for help or request new integrations [here](https://feedback.lovable.dev/)
.

Edge Function and Configuration Errors

Errors in edge functions can disrupt workflows. To resolve these issues:

1.  Review edge function logs to identify and fix errors.
2.  Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
3.  Confirm that environment variables are correctly configured.

For more information, refer to [Supabase’s edge function examples](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions)
 for best practices.

Session and Data Management

Managing sessions and data effectively is critical for smooth app performance. Follow these tips:

*   Use [Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)
    ’s real-time features (or similar services) for seamless data syncing.
*   Ask Lovable to implement strong authentication and token refresh mechanisms for session management.
*   Regularly verify that your database schema is up-to-date to prevent potential data integrity issues.

Repository and Account Management

For smooth repository management and account syncing:

*   Verify that [GitHub repository access permissions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration)
     are correctly configured.
*   Use Lovable’s **built-in rollback feature** for undoing accidental changes, as your projects are automatically backed up.

This ensures safe and reliable version control for your projects.

Debug CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) related errors

*   **Ensure the correct headers** (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).
    
*   **Check the API server** for CORS policy settings.
    
*   **Use a proxy** or adjust the front-end request mode.
    

Common ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) issues

ARIA errors usually occur when accessibility attributes are missing or incorrectly implemented. To avoid these:

*   Use **semantic HTML** (e.g., `<button>` instead of `<div>` for clickable items).
    
*   Follow **ARIA best practices** when defining elements.
    
*   Test with **accessibility tools** (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
    

Role-Based Security (RLS) in Supabase

If RLS is enabled:

*   Define **clear policies** for who can read/write data.
    
*   Test queries using **Supabase SQL editor**.
    
*   Ensure users are properly authenticated before making requests.

Custom domain

When you create a project, Lovable makes it easy to [publish it](../features/deploy)
 with the click of a button.

If you want to have a custom domain, see below.

[​](#using-netlify)

Using Netlify
------------------------------------

You can host on Netlify for free with a custom domain.

The steps are:

1.  Ensure that your project is successfully transferred to GitHub. In the Lovable editor, click on “Transfer to GitHub” located in the top right corner.
    
2.  Head over to Netlify and log in using your GitHub credentials.
    
3.  In Netlify, you’ll need to follow these simple steps: Click on “Import from Git” > Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories > Select your Lovable repository from the provided list > Click “Deploy”
    
4.  Let’s proceed to configure your custom domain directly within Netlify: Go to “Domain Management” > Click “Add a domain” > Enter your domain name > Click “Verify” > Follow the DNS configuration prompts
    
5.  Your Lovable app will automatically redeploy to Netlify whenever you make changes in Lovable.
    

You will need to bring an existing domain or purchase one.

[​](#using-vercel)

Using Vercel
----------------------------------

1.  **Create a Github repository**: Open your project in Lovable and click GitHub then “create repository” if you haven’t already done so. This will commit your code to the `main` branch and create a repository. Once you do this, all changes made to code in your app will automatically be commited to your Github repository on each change.
    
2.  **Set up Vercel**: Go to the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/)
     and create an account. Configure your domain and set the necessary GitHub permissions (make sure to handle DNS settings properly).
    
3.  **Automatic deployments**: Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes from the `main` branch each time it is updated. You can make one or two small changes to your app on Lovable and then visit Vercel deployments to ensure updates are being redeployed from `main`. Once confirmed, do the next step:
    
4.  **Create a Development branch**: In your GitHub repository settings in Lovable, commit all new changes to a second branch called `dev` (or whatever you want).
    
5.  **Configure Vercel Builds**: Go back to Vercel and adjust your settings to ensure it only builds production deployments from the `main` branch.
    

1.  **Make changes in Development**: Work on your app in the Lovable. Any changes will go to the `dev` branch now and wont automatically be deployed via Vercel.
    
2.  **Deploy new changes**: When you’re ready to push new changes to your domain, go to GitHub and perform a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Once you complete and merge the pull request, Vercel will automatically deploy the updates in about one minute.
    

### 

[​](#notes)

Notes:

*   If you hit the 100/day deployment limit in Vercel (it builds your `dev` branch but doesn’t deploy it). You can ask Lovable chat to build you vercel.json file which will force Vercel to not build development builds at all.
    
*   **Supabase Consideration**: Currently, you can only utilize one Supabase instance. So, if you make extensive SQL changes, it could potentially break production. Unfortunately, we can’t yet provide specific guidelines for this scenario as it’s complex. Frequently test your production environment if you make changes related to Supabase.

GitHub Integration

To make it easier for developers to work together with the AI on projects, Lovable backs all projects with a git repository and lets you push commits directly to the repository.

In order to push commits to [GitHub](https://lovable.dev/blog/what-is-github)
, your project and Lovable will automatically pull them in and update the project. This allows you to make changes yourself, without asking the AI.

[​](#connecting-a-project-to-your-github-account)

Connecting a project to your GitHub account
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before pushing your first commit, you will need to connect your GitHub account to the project. You can do this by navigating to **GitHub → Connect to GitHub**. You will then be redirected to GitHub to authorize the connection.

You can choose to either grant access to:

1.  All repositories
    
2.  Specific repositories
    

Both options will let Lovable create repositories in your GitHub account or organization.

You can only connect one GitHub login to your Lovable account, but you can create repositories in any of the organizations you choose to install the Lovable app in.

You will need admin access if you are trying to create a repository in an organization.

[​](#making-changes-to-a-project-through-commits)

Making changes to a project through commits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have connected your GitHub account to your project, you can view the source code by navigating to **GitHub → View on GitHub**.

Any change you make and push to the repository will be automatically reflected in Lovable.

You can commit changes directly in GitHub Codespaces or clone the repo to use your preferred IDE.

Integrations

Stripe & Payments

Setting up payments in your app can be done using our [**Stripe integration**](https://lovable.dev/blog/how-to-connect-stripe-lovable)
. Before implementing Stripe, we recommend ensuring that all necessary frontend and backend infrastructure is in place.

For example, if you are selling individual products, make sure they are properly implemented, that you have a working shopping cart function and checkout page.

If you are offering subscriptions, ensure that all login functionalities and different subscription tiers are set up and working correctly.

[​](#requirements)

**Requirements**
--------------------------------------

*   The project **must** be connected to Supabase. [Learn more about Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)
    
*   You will also need a Stripe account with the corresponding products set up correctly.
    

When you’re ready to proceed, simply ask the AI to add the integration.

**Example prompt**

    Add Stripe to collect payments, please.
    

You’ll then be presented with a list of prerequisites and an option to enter the Stripe API key. You can find this key in your Stripe account dashboard under **Developers → API keys → Secret key**. Submit the key by clicking on the **“Add API key”** button.

The next step is to add the different price IDs for each product. These can be found by navigating to the product in the Stripe product catalog, clicking on the price, and locating the price ID in the top right corner.

**Example prompt**

    The vase has the price_id:
    xxx
    
    The bowl has the price_id:
    xxx
    
    The plate has the price_id:
    xxx
    

**Please note** Stripe integration doesn’t work in preview. To test the integration, make sure to deploy. You should also make sure to be in test mode in Stripe when trying out the functionality.

When testing payment, card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any 3 digits as CVC and any future date will work as a card.

[​](#how-to-set-up-webhooks-correctly)

How to set up webhooks correctly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you for example are providing a subscription-based model where paying for a subscription should unlock different tiers on your website, an Edge Function and corresponding webhook are necessary to upgrade user tiers after a payment is successfully processed.

The Edge Function that handles the necessary changes to the user account should be set up automatically by the AI.

[​](#steps-to-set-up-webhooks)

**Steps to set up webhooks:**
---------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[​](#0-build-a-pricing-component)

**0\. Build a pricing component:**

### 

[​](#1-get-the-endpoint-url)

**1\. Get the endpoint URL**

*   Retrieve the **endpoint URL** from the Edge Function that you have set up.
    
*   This can be found under the specific Edge Function details in your Supabase dashboard.
    

### 

[​](#2-add-the-endpoint-url-in-stripe)

**2\. Add the endpoint URL in Stripe**

*   Navigate to **Developers → Webhooks → Create an event destination** in your Stripe dashboard.
    
*   Select events. If unsure which to select, please ask the AI in chat mode for guidance on which event(s) to choose based on your use case.
    
*   Add the endpoint URL that you retrieved from the Edge Function.
    

### 

[​](#3-get-the-webhook-secret)

**3\. Get the webhook secret**

*   Once the webhook is created, copy the webhook secret provided by Stripe.

### 

[​](#4-store-the-webhook-secret-securely)

**4\. Store the webhook secret securely**

*   Add the webhook secret to Supabase as a secret value **(Supabase → Edge Functions → Manage secrets → Add new secret)**. Ask the AI in chat mode what the secret should be called to work properly with the Edge function.

By following these steps, your Edge Function and corresponding webhook will be properly set up to handle subscription-based upgrades securely and efficiently.

To troubleshoot during testing you can check Stripe and the specific webhook to see error messages. These error messages can be sent to Lovable for debugging.

Supabase Integration

**For a complete end-to-end tutorial of Supabase visit our [step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/quickstart)
**

[​](#overview)

Overview
--------------------------

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
 is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering real-time databases, authentication services, and file storage. It is built atop [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
, providing robust SQL querying capabilities and seamless integration with existing tools and frameworks. Supabase also features an intuitive web interface for effortless management of users and data.

Discover more about Supabase [here](https://supabase.com/docs)
.

To incorporate Supabase into your Lovable application, start with these steps:

[​](#supabase-setup)

Supabase setup
--------------------------------------

Connecting your Lovable app to Supabase is straightforward. Simply follow the steps following steps:

### 

[​](#step-1-create-a-supabase-account)

Step 1: Create a Supabase account

Register a new Supabase account [here](https://app.supabase.com/sign-up)
 or [sign in](https://app.supabase.com/sign-in)
 if you already have one.

### 

[​](#step-2-create-a-new-project-in-supabase)

Step 2: Create a new project in Supabase.

Click on + New Project, complete the necessary fields, and allow a few minutes for setup.

### 

[​](#step-3-connect-supabase-to-lovable)

Step 3: Connect Supabase to Lovable

1.  In your Lovable Editor, locate the Supabase button in the navbar. Click on it and select “Connect Supabase”.
    
2.  You will be redirected to a page where you will be able to select the relevant organisation.
    
3.  You will be then redirected back to Lovable, where you will need to select the relevant project within that organisation.
    

After completing these steps, you will have to wait some seconds for your Supabase integration to finish. Look at the chat for this confirmation.

[​](#adding-authentication-with-supabase)

Adding Authentication with Supabase
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section details how to integrate the Supabase Authentication service into your Lovable project, providing specific guidelines for setup and usage.

### 

[​](#initial-setup)

Initial setup

To initiate authentication, ensure that you have already connected Supabase project to your Lovable project.

To add a basic login page to your project, simply run a prompt similar to the one below.

Example prompt:

    Add login
    

You can then create a user by either:

*   Creating a user directly via the Supabase Dashboard by navigating Supabase -> Authentication -> Users -> Add user.
    
*   Signing up via the login page you’ve added
    

We recommend that you disable the email verification step for now, which you can do in Supabase -> Authentication -> Providers -> Email -> Disable “Confirm email”.

[​](#adding-google-authentication)

Adding Google Authentication
------------------------------------------------------------------

[​](#storing-data-with-supabase)

Storing data with Supabase
--------------------------------------------------------------

Supabase offers a comprehensive Postgres database solution. Supabase enhances the PostgreSQL experience by providing tools that simplify database management. These include a table view that resembles a spreadsheet, capabilities to manage and replicate data relationships, a SQL editor, real-time database interactions, automated backups, and easy data import from CSV or Excel files. Additionally, users can activate various PostgreSQL extensions via the Supabase dashboard.

In order to start building UI that uses your data stored in Supabase simply:

1.  Ask Lovable to create a new feature and that you expect the data to be stored in Supabase.
    
2.  Lovable will then provide you with a SQL snippet that you can run in the SQL editor in Supabase to create the table(s).
    
3.  Once you confirm that you have run the SQL snippet, then Lovable will update the UI to allow you to interact with the data stored in Supabase.
    

[​](#storing-secrets-with-supabase)

Storing secrets with Supabase
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are connected to Supabase, secret keys can be added to Lovable in two ways:

1.  In the project settings.
    
2.  In the chat if you ask it to show the secrets form.
    

These keys will be stored safely in Supabase’s edge function secret manager. These keys will be used when running Edge Functions and will let them connect to services as OpenAI, Stripe, Anthropic and more.

[​](#edge-functions)

Edge Functions
--------------------------------------

You can now also use Edge Functions to add powerful backend features like:

*   Using AI to enhance your app’s capabilities
    
*   Sending emails to your users
    
*   Processing payments
    
*   Running scheduled tasks
    

Lovable will write and deploy Edge Functions to your Supabase project when implementing backend functionality.

When troublehsooting, you can visit the the logs for your Edge Function in Supabase -> Functions -> Logs.

Important Note: Before you deploy your app to production or use any real data, you will need to review and set up the appropriate RLS policies. Lovable can help with that.

Tips and Tricks

Using images in Lovable

To add images you can do one of two things:

1.  Upload the image to the chat: Lovable will automatically use it in the project if relevant.
    
2.  Upload it to the github repository manually, outside of the Lovable UI
    
3.  Share an external image URL in the chat.
    

This will not work if the server hosting the URL has chosen to block external websites from using it with “CORS”

Below, we’ll walk you through the last two methods.

[​](#using-the-prompt)

Using the prompt
------------------------------------------

Want to add images directly to your application? Simply upload them in the chat and explain to Lovable’s AI where and how you’d like them to appear in your project.

[​](#using-an-external-image-url)

Using an external image URL
----------------------------------------------------------------

One way to add images to your project is by referencing an image from an external URL. This method allows you to use images hosted on external platforms like Unsplash, Imgur, or any other image-hosting service. Be mindful of use copyrights!

Here’s how to prompt Lovable to use an external image:

*   First, find the image you want to use. For example, you can visit a site like Unsplash, select an image, and copy its URL.
    
*   In your project prompt, simply tell Lovable to use that image by specifying the URL. For example:
    

    Use the image from this URL 
    https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png/442px-Pale_Blue_Dot.png 
    for the hero section image.
    
    

* * *

[​](#using-images-from-your-github-public-directory)

Using images from your GitHub `public` directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another method to add images to your Lovable project is by using images uploaded to the `public` directory of your connected GitHub repository. Here’s how you can do it:

**Connect your GitHub repository** - Ensure your project is connected to your GitHub repo. [Here’s how to connect your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration)
.

**Locate the public folder** - Inside your GitHub repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is typically used for hosting assets like images that can be referenced in your project. Click on **Add file** and then from a dropdown, select **Upload files** option.

**Upload an image** - The next step is to transfer your image to your repo

*   Drag and drop the image into the public folder, or
    
*   Click on the **“choose your files”** link to browse and select the image file.
    

**Commit the changes** - After selecting your image, write a simple commit message (e.g., “Adding image files to be used in the app”) and click **“Commit changes”** to save the file to your repo.

**Get the image path** - Once the file is uploaded, select it and then click on the copy icon next to the file name to copy the image’s path. This path will be used in your Lovable prompt.

**Use the image in Lovable** - You can now reference this image in your project by using a prompt like the following:

    Add an additional image to the hero section. 
    This time, use this one from my local repo: public/c-64-close-up.jpg.jpeg
    
    

Be sure to use your image name and path you copied in the previous step.

Uploading large images to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

Try to optimize your images before uploading them to your `public` folder by compressing them and using dimensions that are relevant to your use case. For example, don’t use a full HD-sized image if it will only be displayed as a small icon.

Tips and Tricks

Using Videos

Lovable offers two methods for embedding videos into your projects: by linking to an external video (such as YouTube) or by using videos uploaded to the public folder in your GitHub repository. Below, we’ll cover both options step by step.

[​](#linking-to-an-external-video)

Linking to an external video
------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest and recommended way to incorporate a video is by linking to one hosted externally, like on YouTube.

[​](#using-a-video-from-your-github-public-folder)

Using a video from your GitHub public folder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uploading large videos to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

A better option is to use hosted services (like YouTube) or file storage options like S3, essentially giving you a URL that you can reference, as described in the previous steps.

You can upload videos to your project’s GitHub repository and reference them directly. Here’s how:

**Connect your GitHub repository** - First, make sure your project is linked to a GitHub repo. [Here’s how to set up your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration)
.

**Access the public folder** - Inside your connected repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is specifically used for hosting project assets like images, videos, and other media.

**Upload a video** - You can now add your video to the public folder by either dragging and dropping it or clicking **“choose your files”** to browse and upload the file from your local machine.

**Commit the file** - After selecting your video file, enter a brief commit message (e.g., “Adds a Mars video to be used in the app”) and click **“Commit changes”**.

**Get the video path** - Once the upload is complete, click on the video file and use the copy icon :octicons-copy-16: to copy its path. You’ll need this path in the next step.

**Reference the video in Lovable** - Now, you can embed the video by specifying the file path in your prompt. For example, you can use a prompt like this one:

Ensure you use the exact file path you copied earlier.

Tips and Tricks

Multiple Users

At this time, Lovable doesn’t fully support team plans or multiple users on the same project. We are actively considering this feature for future updates. However, we’ve noticed that some users have found a workaround for collaborating on the same project.

The workaround involves creating a single account (registering through the regular sign-up process) and then sharing the credentials for that account with the users you want to give access to.

This allows multiple people to log in and work on the same project (not at the same time, however!)

**Be cautious when sharing account credentials**

If you choose to share an account with others, please only do so with trusted users. Everyone using the shared account will have access to the same information, projects, and edits, and it will be impossible to track who made specific changes.

For security and accountability, we recommend being very cautious when sharing your credentials.

**Consider separate login credentials**

If you signed up using Google or GitHub sign-in, and you share those login details with others, you are also granting them access to your Google or GitHub account. This could expose sensitive personal information.

A safer approach would be to create a separate email account specifically for Lovable and share that account instead, to avoid giving access to unrelated services like your Gmail or GitHub repositories.

Please note that this is not an officially supported feature of Lovable but rather a workaround that we’ve observed users employing.

We recommend considering the risks before proceeding with this method.

Tips and Tricks

Using npm packages

While Lovable is powerful on its own, enabling users to build sophisticated web applications, you can leverage npm packages for more advanced and extended features. These packages help you build even more complex and feature-rich applications with ease.

**What is npm?**

npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to share and reuse code. It hosts thousands of packages, which are pieces of reusable code, that you can easily integrate into your projects to extend functionality.

You can access it [at npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
.

[​](#using-npm-packages-for-advanced-features)

Using npm packages for advanced features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s say you’d like to create a tool that enables you to arrange your tasks in different Kanban boards, similar to many popular project management tools. You can prompt Lovable to build this tool from scratch, but it might be slower and more challenging to achieve the desired functionality.

Instead, you can use npm packages to simplify and speed up the process. For example, the [@hello-pangea/dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hello-pangea/dnd)
 package provides robust drag-and-drop functionality. By using this package, you can easily create a Kanban board where users can add new cards, move them within columns, and reorder them.

This prompt directs Lovable to integrate the package into your project, making it easier to achieve the desired functionality. Depending on other requirements, your result might look somewhat like this.

[​](#quality-and-responsibility)

Quality and responsibility
--------------------------------------------------------------

It’s important to note that while npm packages can significantly enhance your projects, Lovable cannot guarantee the quality or reliability of these third-party packages.

The functionality and performance of npm packages are the responsibility of the end user, and it’s essential to thoroughly test and validate them within your application.

### 

[​](#increasing-your-chances-of-success)

Increasing your chances of success

Here are a few strategies to help you evaluate the legitimacy and quality of npm packages before integrating them into your projects.

*   **Number of downloads** - Check the number of downloads on the package’s npm page. A high number of downloads typically indicates that the package is widely used and trusted by the community.
    
*   **Maintenance status and latest updates** - Look at the package’s repository to see if it is actively maintained. Frequent commits, recent updates, and responsiveness to issues are good indicators of an actively maintained package. Ensure the package has recent updates. A package that is regularly updated is more likely to be compatible with the latest versions of dependencies and security practices.
    
*   **Reviews and community feedback** - A lot of npm packages are hosted on GitHub or similar code repositories. Read through reviews, discussions, and feedback from other developers on those locations, too. Additionally, specific developer forums can provide insights into the package’s reliability and any potential issues.

Tips and Tricks

Using Custom (Google) Fonts

Currently, Lovable does not support direct uploads of custom fonts. However, there are several easy ways to use web-safe or incorporate custom fonts into your projects.

Below, we’ll guide you through the available methods for using web-safe and Google fonts.

**What are web-safe fonts?**

Web-safe fonts are fonts that are commonly installed on most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) and are visible on all devices.

These fonts ensure that your text looks consistent across different browsers and platforms without needing to load any external resources. Some of the common web-safe fonts are:

*   Arial/Helvetica
*   Times New Roman
*   Georgia
*   Courier New
*   Verdana
*   Tahoma
*   Trebuchet MS
*   Lucida Sans Unicode

[​](#using-a-web-safe-font)

Using a web-safe font
----------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a web-safe font in your project, you can specify the font directly in your prompt. For example, if you want to use **Courier New** for a heading or title in the hero section, simply reference the font by name in your prompt.

    Use Courier New as the heading font in the hero section for the main title.
    

Web-safe fonts like Courier New ensure that your project will have consistent typography across all platforms without requiring external resources to load the font. However, they can limit your creativity. Lucikly, there are otions like the ability to use Google Fonts.

[​](#using-google-fonts)

Using Google Fonts
----------------------------------------------

If you prefer to use custom fonts, Lovable works nicely with **Google Fonts**. This allows you to easily use a wide range of fonts in your project. You can either reference a Google font by name or by linking directly to the font resource.

### 

[​](#using-by-name)

Using by name

In your prompt, you can specify the name of a Google font, and Lovable will include it in your project. For example:

    Use Playfair Display as the first subtitle title font in the hero section. 
    
    Make sure to use the useEffect React hook to apply the font properly.
    

### 

[​](#using-by-link)

Using by link

Alternatively, you can provide a direct link to the Google font, and Lovable will use that font in your project. You can get the link from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
 by selecting the desired font and copying the link.

Here’s how to prompt Lovable to use a Google font via a link:

    Add this Google font link https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script 
    and use this font for the third subtitle.
    
    Make sure to load the font using the useEffect React hook.
    

By following these methods, you can customize the typography of your Lovable project using either web-safe fonts or Google Fonts.

[​](#further-learning-and-examples)

Further learning and examples
